# CryptoCraft Hub 🛡️✨
## Problem Statement 🤔
In our increasingly digital world, securing sensitive information is paramount. Whether it's personal messages or critical business data, the need for robust encryption and hashing is undeniable. CryptoCraft Hub addresses this need, providing a comprehensive suite of cryptographic and hash algorithms to fortify data against prying eyes and ensure its integrity.

# Methodology 🕵️‍♂️
## AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)
AES, the gold standard in symmetric encryption, transforms plaintext into ciphertext using a secret key. Its strength lies in its adaptability, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. CryptoCraft Hub's implementation adheres to the highest standards, ensuring your data is shielded with the best encryption technology available.

## DES (Data Encryption Standard)
An encryption classic, DES employs key-based permutation to secure data. While surpassed by AES in strength, DES remains relevant in certain contexts. CryptoCraft Hub's DES implementation is a nod to the past, offering users a glimpse into the history of encryption while maintaining the highest standards of security.

## SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)
SHA-1 generates a fixed-size hash value, crucial for data integrity verification and secure storage. Despite being largely replaced by stronger hash functions, CryptoCraft Hub includes SHA-1 for compatibility and historical understanding. Users can rely on SHA-1 for tasks where a 160-bit hash value is suitable.

## SHA-256 (Secure Hash Algorithm 256-bit)
In a world where security is paramount, SHA-256 offers enhanced protection by generating a robust 256-bit hash value. CryptoCraft Hub's SHA-256 implementation is a powerhouse, providing users with a secure and efficient tool for hashing data, ensuring its integrity in a variety of applications.

##MD-5 (Message Digest Algorithm 5)
MD-5, a widely used hash function, generates a 128-bit hash value. While considered less secure than SHA-256, MD-5 remains relevant in certain scenarios. CryptoCraft Hub's MD-5 implementation caters to users who require a quick and efficient hash function for specific use cases.
